# Rustenstein3d
Basically, it feels like all the hard or fun problems are already solved.  They're not, but its still surely harder to find the unpicked fruit. So,  I sometimes like to solve problems that have already been solved, that I wish I could have been around to solve :D 

This is an implementation of a raycasting engine, from scratch / without looking anything up about raycasters (other than the knowing what one can't look up and down,  that the map is basically 2d, and that the overall idea is that rays of light are leaving the player -- so despite what I said, there was a good bit of info to start from)

This was also done to familiarize myself with Rust, as its a language I've been interested in for a while, due to its similarities with Haskell, among other design decisions

This was a lot of fun :D
